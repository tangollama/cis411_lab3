# Step 4: Exercising the application / generating performance data :heavy_check_mark:

_Note: No lab notes required._

# Step 5: Explore your performance data :heavy_check_mark:

* What are your observations regarding the performance of this application?<br> 
Some queries take much longer than others. However, there are no errors, so this
application is reliable, yet lacking in efficiency.
* Is performance even or uneven?<br> 
The performance is uneven across different queries; however, it's fairly even when it
comes to the same query.
* Between queries and mutations, what requests are less performant?<br> 
Mutations are much quicker than queries, so queries are less performant.
* Among the less performant requests, which ones are the most problematic?<br>
The request using `query: "everything"` is the most problematic in terms of the amount of time it takes to execute.
 
# Step 6: Diagnosing an issue based on telemetry data :heavy_check_mark:
* Within the transactions you're examining, what segment(s) took the most time?<br>
For almost all the queries, the `Remainder` segment took the most time. For some that searched for a specific attribute,
`Middleware: <anonymous>` under the `Expressjs` took the longest, followed by `post /` under the same category.
For the least performant query, the `queryOrderBySearchTerm` was the segment that took the most time.

* Using New Relic, identify and record the least performant request(s).<br>

The following is the least performant request:
```
{
  #retrieve all orders container the word everything
  orders(query: "everything") {
    id
    customer {
      id
      email
    }
    items {
      label
      quantity
    }
  }
}
``` 
It took 42.6 seconds to respond.
* Using the Transaction Trace capability in New Relic, identify which segment(s) in that request permiatation is/are the most problematic and record your findings.<br>
The segment that takes up the most time is `queryOrdersBySearchTerm`. 
* Recommend a solution for improving the performance of those most problematic request(s) / permiatation(s).<br>
Using `bagel: "everything"` rather than `query: "everything"` improves the performance tremendously. 
This is because the application searches under the "bagel" parameter of the order rather than every
attribtue of every order in the database.
# Step 7: Submitting a Pull Request :heavy_check_mark:
_Note: No lab notes required._

# Step 8: [EXTRA CREDIT] Address the performance issue(s) :heavy_check_mark:
For the purposes of gaining 25% extra credit on the assignment, perform any of the following:
1. Adjust the diagnosed slow call(s) to improve performance. 
2. Verify the improved performance in New Relic, **including data and/or screenshots in your lab report**.
2. Check in those changes and **note your solution(s)** in your lab report.<br><br>
By changing `query: "everything"` to `bagel: "everything"` in the code for the most troublesome query
(as shown below),
the time was reduced by more than 99%. (Performance went from 42.6 seconds to much less than half a second.)
```
{
  #retrieve all orders container the word everything
  orders(bagel: "everything") {
    id
    customer {
      id
      email
    }
    items {
      label
      quantity
    }
  }
}
```
